# NOTE THIS IS VERY EARLY SOFTWARE. WHILE IT SHOULD WORK IN PRODUCTION PLEASE DO NO RELY ON IT
OpenSpeed is a FOSS network testing web application.

Noteable features include

* Measurement of Download, Upload and Latency.
* Memory Allocated Testing Files (Not really a mind blowing feature since test files are cached anyway)
* Mobile Friendly interface


The goal is to support multiple servers from a single web interface and expand on telemtry and logging in order to provide home users and Internet Service Providers (if enabled through the web interface) with helpful information about connections.
