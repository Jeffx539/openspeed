# NOTE: THIS IS VERY EARLY SOFTWARE. WHILE IT SHOULD WORK IN PRODUCTION, PLEASE DO NOT RELY ON IT

OpenSpeed is a F/OSS network testing web application.

Notable features include:
* Measurement of upload/download speeds and latency
* Memory allocated test files
* Mobile friendly responsive interface
* Low usage of system resources

The goal is to support multiple servers from a single web interface and expand on telemetry and logging in order to provide home users and Internet Service Providers (if enabled through the web interface) with helpful information about connections.
