# OpenSpeed

OpenSpeed Is a FOSS Network Testing Application

Noteable features include

* Measurement of Download, Upload and Latency throughout the test.
* Memory Allocated Testing Files (Not really a mind blowing feature since test files are cached anyway)
* Mobile Friendly interface



The goal is to eventually support multiple servers from a single web interface and expand on telemtry and logging. The goal is to provide Users and Internet Service Providers (if enabled through the web interface) with helpful information about their connections.
